<p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first instalment of a two-part film based on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling.</p>

<p>David Yates, who directed the preceding two films, directed both parts, with Steve Kloves returning to script. The first part was released on November 19, 2010, with the second following in July 2011. Production of the two films occurred concurrently, and treated as if it were one film. The idea to split the films had been around since the middle of 2007, but only really came into serious consideration after producer David Heyman was able to talk to writer Steve Kloves when the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike ended and Heyman had Rowling's approval.</p>
