<p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a British-American fantasy film based on the fifth novel by J. K. Rowling, released on 11 July, 2007 in the U.S. and 12 July, 2007 in the U.K. David Yates made his directorial debut for the series, as did Michael Goldenberg for writing and David Barron for producing, while David Heyman returned from the first four films to produce. Reprising their roles from the previous films are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, David Bradley, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Robert Hardy, Julie Walters and Mark Williams, while Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, George Harris and Natalia Tena make their debut for the series.</p>

<p>This film is the only one of the series for which Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay. When asked why he turned it down, he said "You know, I don’t even know why. The fourth film, Goblet of Fire, was really hard to do. I wrote on it for two years. But it’s not that simple and I don’t know that I’ll ever fully understand why I didn’t do it. This will sound glib, but it’s somewhat true: They asked me on the wrong day."</p>
