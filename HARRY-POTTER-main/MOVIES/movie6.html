<p>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a British-American fantasy film based on the sixth novel by J. K. Rowling, released on 15 July, 2009. David Yates returned to direct the sequel to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as did David Heyman and David Barron to produce,[3] and Steve Kloves, though he did not write the fifth film, returned to write.[4] Reprising their roles from earlier films are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, Bonnie Wright, David Bradley, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Gemma Jones, Natalia Tena and Mark Williams, while Jim Broadbent and Helen McCrory make their debut for the series.</p>

<p>Filming began on 24 September, 2007. Unlike the previous film, the sixth film was released in regular theatres on 15 July and IMAX 3-D on 29 July because of the IMAX release of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[5] The film was chosen to be screened at the Royal Film Performance on 17 November, 2008, but due to the date of release being pushed back, it was not shown. On 7 July, 2009, at the world premiere of Half-Blood Prince in London, the cast and crew all wore white ribbons in memory and tribute of 18-year-old British actor and co-star Robert Knox. Knox, who played Marcus Belby in the film, was stabbed to death on 24 May, 2008</p>
